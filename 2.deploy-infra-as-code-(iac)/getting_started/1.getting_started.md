## Introduction
Cloud Devops is a culture shift where code are use to deploy phy servers instead of softaware or a little bit of both code and software whc is d combinatn of developmt and operation. 

### What is (Cloud) Infrastructure?
Cloud services are broadly categorized as:  
Software as a Service (SaaS)  
Platform as a Service (PaaS) e.g Elastic Beanstack     
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). 

Cloud is a collection of geographically distributed *data centers* that are logically grouped into regions and availability-zones.  

The IaaS allows a user to provision Virtual Machines (VMs), set up networks (VPC), create subnets, and associate necessary security features. VMs can be attached to storage volumes, different networks, or servers. All the resources mentioned above are referred to as *Infrastructure*.  

Examples of Cloud Infrastructure includes:  
VPC  
Public Subnet  
Private Subnet  
Nat gateway  
Internet gateway  
Application Load Balancer  
S3 Buckets  
Amazon RDS  
Instance  
Router  
AutoScaling  
Security grp  

### Overview
To provision cloud-infrastructure resources using (re-usable) scripts:

*Introduction to Cloud Formation:*  
Make use of the Cloud Formation tool to provision and manage cloud infrastructure.    

*Infrastructure Diagrams:*  
Create diagrams for web application architecture that represents how different resources can be placed in the cloud using LucidChart.

*Networking Infrastructure:*  
Provision networking components such as VPN, subnets, route tables, and internet gateway as a part of your cloud infrastructure.  

*Servers and Security Groups*  
Deploy servers with the necessary level of security (firewall rules).   

*Storage and Databases*  
Attach the storage volumes to servers and configure S3 service.  

### What is DevOps?
Dev-Ops means Development and Operations. Operation manages, monitors, configures and deploy software.  

DevOps is the combination of industry best practices, and set of tools that improve an organization’s ability to:  
Increase the speed of software delivery  
Increases the speed of software evolution  
Have better reliability of the software  
Have scalability using automation,  
Improved collaboration among teams.  

### Why you need DevOps?
Issues that DevOps tries to solve:  
Unpredictable deployments: due to the fact dt d operation team don't av an idea of wt d developmt team is doing.  
Mismatched environments (development (dependency env) doesn’t match production (dependency env)): an environmt used for development is different from that being used by the operation team.  
Configuration Drift: configuration being made by d dev team differs from the one available, for instance, in the server.  

### What are the benefits of Cloud DevOps?
DevOps best practices and tools.  
One of the benefits of using DevOps is that it allows predictable deployments using automated scripts. In the DevOps model, development and operations teams are merged into a single team. These DevOps teams use a few tools and best practices that deploy and manage configuration changes to servers.  

The most important practices are:  
Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) - new features are automatically deployed with all the required dependencies.  
Infrastructure as Code (IaaC) - configuration and management of cloud infrastructure using re-usable scripts.  

Other prevalent practices are:  
Microservices  
Monitoring and Logging  
Communication and Collaboration  

Glossary:  
CI/CD: Tracks the development workflow from testing through production. Continuous integration is the process flow of *testing* any change made to your development flow, while continuous deployment tracks those changes through to *staging and production* systems.

Infrastructure as code (IaC): Provision and manages the cloud-infrastructure by using *scripts*. These scripts can be written in YAML or JSON format. These scripts ensure that the same architecture can be re-built multiple numbers of times. These scripts are particularly useful in enterprise applications and different environments - dev, prod, or test.  

### Requirements  
AWS Account  
IAM User(is unaffected by region. it can be used in any one)  
Configure AWS Command Line Interface `aws --version`  


### Set up Tools
*What is CloudFormation?*  
CloudFormation is an AWS tool for creating, managing, configuring, and deploying cloud resources. This tool is beneficial if you have to provision a set of cloud resources multiple times, at scale. You can do so by simply writing (YAML or JSON) scripts that you can easily edit and run numerous times. In the script, each resource's configuration that we want to provision are mentioned and then use the AWS CLI tool and commands to execute the scripts.  

### Creating Access Key ID for IAM User
After installing AWS CLI, recall that you must configure the following four items on your local machine before you can interact with any of the AWS services:  
*Access key* - It is a combination of Access Key ID and a Secret Access Key. You can generate an Access key from the AWS IAM service, and specify the level of permissions (authorization) with the help of IAM Roles.  
*Default AWS Region* - It specifies the AWS Region where you want to send your requests by default.
*Default output format* - It specifies how the results are formatted. It can either be a json, yaml, text, or a table.
*Profile* - A collection of settings is called a profile. The default profile name is default, however, you can create a new profile using the `aws configure --profile new_name` command.

AWS access type  
*Programmatic Access:* In the AWS console, choose "programmatic access." This allows us to use code to interact with AWS, instead of relying on mouse clicking in the console web pages. Choosing this option will Enable the access key ID and secret access key for the AWS CLI.  
*AWS Management Console access:* it is used only when you want the new user to be able to sign-in to the AWS web console using a password.  

Permissions  
*Administrator Access:* The permissions to a user are granted in form of Policies, which are JSON documents. The AWS web console provides a pre-created list of policies to choose from.  

### Configuring AWS CLI
`aws --version`  
`aws configure --profile default` or `aws configure --profile Babs`  

![cf1](cf1.png?raw=true "cf1")

to confirm if it's working:  
`aws s3 ls`  

to list the IAM users in your account
`aws iam list-users`  

Note that each user can have up to 2 access keys at the same time.  

![cf2](cf2.png?raw=true "cf2")

*Why Making Keys Inactive is a Better Choice*  
You may make your access key temporarily inactive rather than destroying it and creating a new one. This may be helpful if you want to stop an automated process that uses that key (for example, a CI/CD process).  


### Understanding CloudFormation
CloudFormation handles resource dependencies so that you don’t have to specify which resource to start up before another. There are cases where you can specify that a resource depends on another resource, but ideally, you’ll let CloudFormation take care of dependencies.  

To get the code for any infrastructure, google search `cloudformation infrastructure name` e.g cloudformation vpc.  
 
```
VPC
    Type: AWS::EC2::VPC
    Properties: 
        CidrBlock: 10.0.0.0/16
```
Name: A name you want to give to the resource.  
Type: Specifies the actual hardware resource that you’re deploying.  
Properties: Specifies configuration options for your resource. Think of these as all the drop-down menus and checkbox options that you would see in the AWS console if you were to request the resource manually.  
Stack: A stack is a group of resources. These are the resources that you want to deploy, and that are specified in the YAML file.
