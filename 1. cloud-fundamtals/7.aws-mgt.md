## Why do we need logging and auditing in the cloud?
Logging In The Cloud
Logging provides visibility into your cloud resources and applications.  
Logging allows you to answer important questions like:  
How is this server performing?  
What is the current load on the server?  
What is the root cause of an application error that a user is seeing?  
What is the path that leads to this error?  


## Cloud Trail
Cloud Trail allows you to audit (or review) everything that occurs in your AWS account. Cloud Trail does this by recording all the AWS API calls occurring in your account and delivering a log file to you.  

Features  
CloudTrail provides event history of your AWS account activity, including:  
who has logged in  
services that were accessed  
actions performed  
parameters for the actions  
responses returned  
This includes actions taken through the AWS Management Console, AWS SDKs, command line tools, and other AWS services.  

CloudTrail shows results for the last 90 days.  
You can create up to five trails in an AWS region.  

## Cloud Watch
Cloud Watch is a service that monitors resources and applications that run on AWS by collecting data in the form of logs, metrics, and events.  

There are several useful features:  
Collect and track metrics  
Collect and monitor log files  
Set alarms and create triggers to run your AWS resources  
React to changes in your AWS resources  

Metrics are provided automatically for a number of AWS products and services.  

## What is Infrastructure as Code and why do we need it?
*Infrastructure as Code*  
Infrastructure as Code allows you to describe and provision all the infrastructure resources in your cloud environment. You can stand up servers, databases, runtime parameters, resources, etc. based on scripts that you write. Infrastructure as Code is a time-saving feature because it allows you to provision (or stand up) resources in a reproducible way.  

It is the process of managing and provisioning computer data centers through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools

*Cloud Formation*  
AWS Cloud Formation allows you to model your entire infrastructure in a text file template allowing you to provision AWS resources based on the scripts you write.

Cloud Formation templates are written using JSON or YAML.
You can still individually manage AWS resources that are part of a CloudFormation stack.

## CloudFormation Designer
Check on the left hand pane
AWS CloudFormation Designer is the graphic tool for creating, 
viewing and modifying AWS Cloudformation templates. You can diagram
your template resources using drag and drop of the available resources
in resource types on the left hand pane.

## AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)
The AWS CLI (or Command Line Interface) allows you to access and control services running in your AWS account from the command line. To use the CLI, simply download, install, and configure it.

Usage
The AWS Command Line Interface User Guide walks you through installing and configuring the tool. After that, you can begin making calls to your AWS services from the command line.
$ aws ec2 describe-instances  

$ aws ec2 start-instances --instance-ids i-1348636c  

$ aws sns publish --topic-arn arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:546419318123:OperationsError --message "Script Failure"  

$ aws sqs receive-message --queue-url https://queue.amazonaws.com/54641931812  

File Commands for Amazon S3  
$ aws s3 ls s3://mybucket
s3://mybucket is d bucket name
