# Diagrams
Diagrams are a very important starting point for planning your cloud infrastructure. DevOps engineers start with a visual representation of the required cloud infrastructure before they turn it into code.  

Open your browser and navigate to <a href="https://www.lucidchart.com/" target="_blank">Lucid</a> Click on Shapes. Select both AWS Architecture 2017 & AWS Architecture 2019 and then Click the X icon in the top right hand corner.  

Search the shapes panel for your shapes.  

### Cloud Container
This represents your AWS account and all resources it can access.  

![aws1](aws1.png?raw=true "aws1")

### Region
A local business may be entirely contained in a region. So, if all your applications are always going to be deployed in the AWS Northern California region ( us-west-1 ) -for example- then you don’t need to specify this in your diagrams because all your co-workers will already know this.  

The exception would be if you are designing a multi-region architecture, say, for Disaster Recovery reasons. In this case, it’s certainly useful to specify the region you are talking about, in your diagrams.

Availability zone is a set of one or more *data centers (physical building)* housing ur computer and services. It is within a region.

High availability: more than one AZs.  
Low cost: using one AZs to reduce cost.

#### Best Practices
Choose to have more than one availability zone to avoid a single point of failure and for high availability, .  
You may choose to reduce to one AZ, possibly for prototyping and design for low cost. But it is not recommended for production environments.  

### Virtual Private Cloud
A virtual private cloud is a pool of networked cloud resources. It can span more than one availability zone.  
The equivalent of this would be a data center. VPCs can span more than one physical building. This is an amazing feature that protects against real world disasters like electrical failures, fires and similar events.  

The main attribute of a VPC is d blk of available IP addresses known as address space and CIDR block.  

![aws4](aws4.png?raw=true "aws4")

![aws3](aws3.png?raw=true "aws3")

An IPv4 address is made up of four octets.
*10.0.0.0/16*. i.e each of 10.0.0.0 can go from 0-255.


I could create 255 of this smaller subnets within our VPC by doing [10.0.2.0, 10.0.2.1, 10.0.2.2, 10.0.2.3.....10.0.2.255], [10.0.3.0, 10.0.3.1, 10.0.3.2, 10.0.3.3...... 10.0.3.255], and so on. (Ignore system-reserved IP addresses).

A subnet creates logical separation btw resources. It also helps to blk or allow access to and from resources through routing. and also helps with providing public ip address to access a specific set of resources and nt others


### Subnets
![aws5](aws5.png?raw=true "aws5")

A subnet is a subset of the overall VPC network and *it only exists in a single availability zone*, unlike its parent network, the VPC.  

A subnet contains resources, and can be assigned access rights that apply to all resources within that subnet. Subnets can be public or private. Public subnets are accessible to external users. Private subnets are only accessed internally by other resources within your cloud container.  

### Use IP addresses for routing traffic
Use IP addresses as the “keys” for routing traffic. We can route traffic to stay within the VPC, or within a particular subnet, for security reasons. For example, a database or any sensitive data will be placed in a private subnet. A public server, like a web server, can be placed in a public subnet. Routing rules applied to a subnet allow us to define access to all resources placed inside that subnet.  

### VPC Internet Gateway
![aws6](aws6.png?raw=true "aws6")
Software Defined Networking  
What we have created here it's called Software Defined Networking. That is, using APIs and already-existing physical infrastructure to create our own networking layer on top, with our own privacy rules, our own routing and our own Private IP Space.  

VPN or Virtual Private Network  
It is a type of encrypted connectivity that You can setup between your on-premise data center and your Virtual Private Cloud. This allows access in and out of your AWS VPC in a secure manner, across the internet and using internal, Private IP addresses.  

DirectConnect  
DirectConnect is a physical data line that you can purchase directly from AWS or through a telecommunication service provider to access your AWS Cloud without moving your data traffic across the public internet.  

Internet Gateway  
An internet gateway is a resource that enables inbound and outbound traffic from the internet to your VPC.
An internet gateway allows external users access to communicate with parts of your VPC.  
If you create a private VPC for an application that is internal to your company, you will not need an internet gateway.  

### VPC Network Address Translation (NAT Gateway)
It provides a way for servers/instances in the private subnet to access the Internet. NAT Gateway keeps the private instances protected from unsolicited inbound connections from the Internet.  

To provide outbound internet access to resources in the private subnets, we configure the NAT gateway to route the outbound requests to the Internet gateway for the VPC. While routing the outbound requests, the NAT gateway replaces the source instances' (private) IP address with NAT's own (public) IP address.  

When sending the "response" traffic back to the instances, the NAT gateway translates the addresses back to the original source IP address, meaning it "translates" the incoming response into private traffic.  

In summary, the NAT gateway serves as an intermediary to take a private resource's request, connect to the Internet, and then relay the response back to the private resource without exposing that private resource's IP address to the public.  

NAT Gateway needs public access itself; remember to place it in the public subnet. Place NAT gateway inside the public subnet so that it can communicate with the public Internet and handle requests from resources in a private subnet.  

![aws7](aws7.png?raw=true "aws7")

The NAT gateway replaces the source IP address of the instances with the IP address of the NAT gateway. For a public NAT gateway, this is the elastic IP address of the NAT gateway. For a private NAT gateway, this is the private IP address of the NAT gateway.   

### Autoscaling groups
AG needs more than one subnet. it can be used for both High Availability and Elasticity. Elasticity is the ability to expand and contract cloud resources to meet demand.  

Autoscaling group: It is a coherent group of Virtual Machines (EC2 instances) that allows running the exact number of VMs that are required to meet the demand/specification. The autoscaling group can automatically start or stop the servers (EC2 instances) according to the amount of incoming traffic. This behavior of the autoscaling group helps in two ways:  

The consumer pays for the only duration of the servers when they were active.  
The consumer doesn't have to worry about horizontal scaling of servers for a sudden peak in incoming traffic.  

Best Practice  
It is recommended that an autoscaling group spans more than one availability zone, for reliability.  
If we set the autoscaling group to run one resource, it will run that one resource in one of the availability zones.  
If there is a failure of that resource, the autoscaling group will shut it down in that availability zone and start that same resource in the other availability zone.  

![aws8](aws8.png?raw=true "aws8")

Resize the Auto Scaling group icon so that it starts in Private Subnet 1, then extends and covers Private Subnet 2.  
![aws9](aws9.png?raw=true "aws9")

### Load Balancers
It's a service designed to distribute requests meant for a target grp. A target grp is a collectn of servers providing an exact same service. As requests come in, d LB will spread d requests evenly across its target grp. It works with public/web servers. It can also be associated with AutoScaling group. It also helps with HealthCheck of the servers. Any server found wanting is removed while in the case of autoscaling, a new is spinned up.

*In a VPC, there is no restriction for its resources to communicate i.e there is no inbound or outbound rule bcos the VPC is a secured/trusted environmt.*  

Without a load balancer, having public-facing servers in more than one AZ would mean that users would have to use a different URL to reach each of the AZs. This can be impractical compared to just a single URL.  
Good practice - Assume we have a set of web-servers in private subnet(s). Then, we must have a Load Balancer that would access our web-servers. These web-servers, in turn, would access the backend database.  

Read about four types of load balancing offered by AWS at different layers of networking protocol:  
Classic load balancer  
Application load balancer  
Network load balancer  

In a diagram, Application Load Balancer is placed on the right side of Internet Gateway.  
![aws10](aws10.png?raw=true "aws10")

### Security Groups
SG involves way to manage traffic. It can be ard instances or services like load balancing. 
Security groups manage traffic at the server level (the resource level). *Security Groups aren’t for managing higher-level groups such as subnets, VPC, or user accounts*.  
The same security group can be assigned to multiple resources that require the same security access settings defined by that security group.  

It is a collection of networking rules for inbound and outbound traffic.

![aws11](aws11.png?raw=true "aws11")

Drag the Security Group container and place it on top of EC2 Instance 2. i.e It shd surround the instance and the autoscaling grp shd surround both.

### Routing Tables
It is a set of entries or rules associated with one or more **subnets** inside VPC.  
The entries in a routing table are about information regarding **how to "move traffic" not about allowing or denying traffic**. A routing table defines the rules, meaning if a packet arrives for a particular destination, then it should be moved towards the defined target.  
To allow/deny traffic at the **network/subnetwork** level you have **ACLs**!.  
To allow/deny traffic at an **instance level**, you have **security groups**.  

For d diagram, the rounting table is plced inbetween the subnets(public and private).  

See the snapshots below to understand the difference between the three: 
![aws12](aws12.png?raw=true "aws12")  
![aws13](aws13.png?raw=true "aws13")  
![aws14](aws14.png?raw=true "aws14")  

**Question: DIFF BTW ROUTE TABLE, ACL, SEC GROUP**  

It is a set of entries or rules associated with one or more **subnets** inside VPC. These rules allow/deny traffic to/from d address ranges specified. Rules can be as open to the entire world(0.0.0.0/0) or restricted to a single IP address.  

![aws15](aws15.png?raw=true "aws15")  

`Public subnet uses Internet gateway to communicate with internet(Outside world) while Private subnet uses Network Address Translation (NAT) Gateway inside the public subnet to communicate securely with internet.`  

### S3 Bucket
An S3 bucket is a public service for users to upload or download files.
Place the S3 service outside of your VPC. In d diagram, it is a public service so it is placed outside of ur VPC i.e. on the outer exterior of your AWS Cloud Container..

### Question: Create a diagram to represent a corporate-only cloud
There is one more real-world scenario that is very popular, but not covered in this course. And that is the “extension of the on-premises network”.  

In this case, you’d have a network that only contains private subnets, and does not have NAT Gateways. These components get replaced by a VGW (Virtual Gateway) and a VPN Connection. You’ll also need a CGW (Customer Gateway), which represents the on-premises side of the VPN Connection.
